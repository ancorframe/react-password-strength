## **Password Strength Meter Project**

This project is a Password Strength Meter implemented using React and Material UI. The main task of this project is to create a field for entering a password and display the strength of the password in real-time. The strength of the password is divided into three categories: easy, medium, and strong. The color of the sections will change depending on the strength of the password.

## **Password Strength Calculation**

The strength of the password is determined based on the combination of letters, digits, and symbols in the password. Here is how the strength is calculated:

*   Only letters/digits/symbols - the password is easy;
*   Combination of letters-symbols/letters-digits/digits-symbols - the password is medium;
*   Has letters, symbols, and numbers - the password is strong;

## **Color Coding**

The color of the sections will change depending on the strength of the password. Here are the color codes used:

*   Gray - indicates that the password field is empty.
*   Red - indicates that the password is weak.
*   Yellow - indicates that the password is of medium strength.
*   Green - indicates that the password is strong.

## **Project Implementation**

To implement this project, we will use React and Material UI. The password field will be created using the Material UI text field component. The strength of the password will be displayed using three Material UI progress bars. The color of the progress bars will be changed based on the strength of the password.

The password strength will be calculated using a function that will be called whenever the user types something in the password field. The strength of the password will be updated in real-time, and the color of the progress bars will be updated accordingly.

## **Conclusion**

In this project, we have implemented a Password Strength Meter using React and Material UI. The strength of the password is calculated based on the combination of letters, digits, and symbols. The color of the progress bars is changed based on the strength of the password. This project is a useful tool for ensuring that passwords are strong and secure.
